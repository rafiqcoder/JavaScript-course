        <h3>Variables</h3>

        <p>
          Computer programs exist to manipulate data. What they basically do is
          receive some input, process it and show some output. So far we haven't
          seen our websites as computer programs yet because we only had static
          pages. But from this moment on, if we want our websites to be dynamic
          and interactive we need to think of them as computer programs running
          on the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take a look at the simple example of interactivity with the user
          below.
        </p>

        <input
          id="user_greeting_input"
          type="text"
          placeholder="Type your name..."
        />
        <button id="user_greeting_confirm">Confirm</button>
        <br />
        <strong id="user_greeting_message"></strong>
        <br />

        <p>
          In this example we are working with data. We get the user input,
          generate the greeting message and show it inside an HTML element.
          There's also some logic involved, because if the field is left blank,
          we replace the user input with "guest user".
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to work with data in a computer program, we need
          <strong>variables.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Variables are used to store data so we can use it later. Therefore we
          need to give them names so we can refer to them. The name of a
          variable is also called the identifier.
        </p>

        <p>
          We create variables using the "var" keyword followed by its name, then
          an equal sign and the value we want to assign to it.
        </p>

        <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var user_name = "guest user";
                    </code>
                </pre>

        <p>
          After assigning the string value "guest user" to the variable, we can
          access it anytime we want. To test it, let's create a variable like
          above and then run the following statement:
        </p>

        <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    console.log(user_name);
                    </code>
                </pre>

        <p>
          What's the use of sending this value to the console? This is a good
          method of testing. Now that we know that our variable was created and
          the value has been correctlly assigned to it we can use it to form the
          greeting message and place it inside that html element.
        </p>

        <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    document.getElementById("user_greeting_message").innerHTML = "Hello " + user_name + "!";
                    </code>
                </pre>

        <p>
          To form the message above we are doing string concatenation. In the
          next lesson we'll talk about data types and you will learn more
          details about this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before we move ahead, we need to know some rules for naming variables.
        </p>

        <h4>Variable names or Identifiers</h4>

        <p>Variable names can contain:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Letters</li>
          <li>Numbers</li>
          <li>Underscores (_)</li>
          <li>Dollar signs ($)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Important: Variable names can contain numbers but
          <strong>they can't start with numbers.</strong> White spaces are also
          not allowed.
        </p>

        <p>See below a few examples of names:</p>

        <pre>
                        <code>
    a             // ok
    
    name          // ok
    
    $name         // ok
    
    students_name // ok
    
    student_1     // ok
    
    1_b           // invalid because it starts with a number
    
    my-name       // invalid because it has a dash (only underscores are allowed)
    
    my name       // invalid because it contains a white space
    
    new           // invalid because 'new' is a Javascript reserved word, like will be explained below.
                        </code>
                    </pre>

        <p>
          If you speak a foreign language avoid using characters that don't
          exist in english, like √ß, √•, √©, –¥, ÂõΩ, etc. Although they are
          acceptable, we should also write universal code that can be easily
          maintained by anyone who understands english.
        </p>

        <h4>Keywords</h4>

        <p>
          Keywords (or reserved words) are used for internal functions and
          commands and therefore can't be used as variable names. See below some
          examples of keywords:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>function</li>
          <li>if</li>
          <li>else</li>
          <li>var</li>
          <li>new</li>
          <li>return</li>
          <li>break</li>
          <li>default</li>
          <li>in</li>
        </ul>

        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp"
          >See the complete list of keywords here.</a
        >

        <h4>Case Sensitive</h4>

        <p>
          As explained earlier, Javascript is a "case sensitive" language, so
          have this in mind when creating your variable names. If you name a
          variable as "username" and then try to call it as "Username" you will
          get an error.
        </p>

        <h4>Keep your names meaningful and self-explanatory</h4>

        <p>
          Good code should be easily understood not only by who wrote it but
          also by other people, so think of that when naming your variables. If
          we're to create a program to get the first and last name of a person,
          which of the names below do you think we should choose:
        </p>

        <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    //Option # 1:
    var first_name = "John";
    var last_name = "Doe";

    //Option # 2:
    var name1 = "John";
    var name2 = "Doe";

    //Option # 3:
    var a = "John";
    var b = "Doe";
                    </code>
                </pre>

        <p>
          It should be pretty obvious that the first option is the best one. The
          second option is acceptable but not very good. The third option is
          terrible.
        </p>

        <h4>Naming convention</h4>

        <p>
          Programming languages normally have naming conventions to make the
          code more easily readable. Javascript programmers usually choose the
          <strong>lower camelCase</strong> style for naming variables. This
          means first letter lowercase and the first letters of subsequent words
          in uppercase.
        </p>

        <pre>
                    <code>
    // camelCase examples:
    
    firstName
    
    lastName
    
    exchangeRate
    
    maxContainerWidth
    
    screenSize
                    </code>
                </pre>

        <p>
          Using only lower case characters and underscores to separate words,
          like last_name or max_container_width is also common. Pick the style
          you feel most comfortable with and keep consistent. Also try to keep
          the names as short as possible, which means that firstName is better
          than firstNameOfTheUser.
        </p>
        <h4>Using <code>let</code> and <code>const</code></h4>

        <p>
          In modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond), instead of using
          <code>var</code>, it's highly recommended to use <code>let</code> and
          <code>const</code> for declaring variables.
        </p>

        <h5>üîπ <code>let</code> ‚Äì Block-scoped Variable</h5>
        <p>
          <code>let</code> allows you to declare variables that are limited in
          scope to the block, statement, or expression where they are used. It
          prevents accidental redeclaration and is safer than <code>var</code>.
        </p>

        <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
                let name = "Alice";
                name = "Bob"; // ‚úÖ Can be reassigned
                
                console.log(name); // Bob
                
                if (true) {
                    let city = "London";
                    console.log(city); // London
                }
                console.log(city); // ‚ùå Error: city is not defined
                    </code>
                </pre>

        <h5>üîπ <code>const</code> ‚Äì Constant Variable</h5>
        <p>
          <code>const</code> is used to declare variables that should never
          change. You must assign a value when you declare it. It also has block
          scope.
        </p>

        <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
                const pi = 3.14159;
                // pi = 3.14; ‚ùå Error: Assignment to constant variable
                
                console.log(pi); // 3.14159
                
                const colors = ["red", "green"];
                colors.push("blue"); // ‚úÖ Allowed: you can change contents of an array
                
                console.log(colors); // ["red", "green", "blue"]
                    </code>
                </pre>

        <h5>üî∏ Summary</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>‚úÖ Use <code>let</code> when the value may change</li>
          <li>
            ‚úÖ Use <code>const</code> when the value should not be reassigned
          </li>
          <li>
            üö´ Avoid <code>var</code> in modern JavaScript unless necessary
            (e.g., for legacy support)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Declaration</th>

              <th>Reassignable?</th>
              <th>Redeclarable?</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code>var</code></td>
              <td>Function scoped</td>
              <td>Yes</td>
              <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>let</code></td>
              <td>Block scoped</td>
              <td>Yes</td>
              <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>const</code></td>
              <td>Block scoped</td>
              <td>No</td>
              <td>No</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          üìå Best Practice: Always start with <code>const</code>. If the value
          needs to change later, switch to <code>let</code>.
        </p>
        let and const (ES6)
        <p>
          Starting from ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript introduced two new
          ways to declare variables: <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.
          These are now preferred over <code>var</code> in most situations
          because they provide better control and avoid common mistakes in
          JavaScript coding.
        </p>
        <pre> <code class="javascript"> // let: use when the variable value will change let age = 25; age = 26; // No problem // const: use when the value should not change const birthYear = 1995; birthYear = 1996; // ‚ùå This will cause an error </code> </pre>
        <h5>
          Why <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are better than
          <code>var</code>
        </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Block Scope:</strong> <code>let</code> and
            <code>const</code> are block-scoped, while <code>var</code> is
            function-scoped.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Hoisting Confusion:</strong> <code>var</code> is hoisted
            to the top of the function or global scope, which can lead to bugs.
            <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> also hoist, but don't allow
            access before declaration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prevent Reassignment:</strong> <code>const</code> helps
            prevent bugs by ensuring a variable‚Äôs value doesn't accidentally
            change.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Examples of Scoping</h5>
        <pre> <code class="javascript"> 
          { let name = "Alice"; console.log(name); // Alice } 
          // console.log(name); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: name is not defined 
          { var city = "New York"; } 
          console.log(city); // ‚úÖ Works, because var is function/global scoped </code> </pre>
        <h5>Best Practices</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <code>const</code> by default.</li>
          <li>
            Use <code>let</code> only if you plan to reassign the variable
            later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid <code>var</code> unless required for backward compatibility.
          </li>
